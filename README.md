# PyghGP / CA Image Classification

<img src="https://github.com/tm224/PushGP-CA-Image-Class/tree/main/output/best_individual--digit1-100steps-cut_size1.gif" width="200" />

Python based project combining the PyshGP library and the cellular-automaton library with the aim of optimising update rules to allow for accurate classification.

**WIP**
Currently CA grid is working to display MNIST digits. Integration between the two libraries still needs to be done.

The cellular automata grid consists of a 2D array of values representing the greyscale intensities of each pixel. This grid is evolved using update rules which are derived from a Push genetic programming algorithm. The end state should correspond with other end states for the same digit.
